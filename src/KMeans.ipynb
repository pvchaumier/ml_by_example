    "# K-Means\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning** algorithms look for structure in **unlabelled** data. One of the common objective is to find **clusters**. Clusters are groups of data that are similar according to a given measurement and different from the datapoints of other clusters. This definition is vague but in the end, the idea is to minimize the distance intra cluster and maximize the distance inter clusters (again, there exists various definition of distance between clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "K-mean is an **iterative** algorithm that can discover such clusters given the number of clusters we are looking for. This is the main drawback as we need to specify this number beforehand. Some more advanced version of K-means are able to discover if the number of clusters is to low or too high but I will not talk much about them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, K-means alternates between the two following steps:\n",
    "- compute the centers of the clusters (for the first step, they are taken at random within the dataset, after that, they are defined as the barycenter/mean of the clusters found by the second step)\n",
    "- build the clusters from the center. A data belong to the cluster defined by the closest center\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain it more sequentially, it begins by choosing at random k centers. Then it seperates the dataset into clusters by computing the distance of all points to all center and saying that a datapoint belongs to the closest center. After that, it computes the mean of the clusters (not that this will change the position of the center and thus the distances to the other points) to find new centers and so on and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this is unclear (as I am sure it will be if you have never heard of the algorithm), go check the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) that contains very well made visual examples of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "I could not plot the successive step within the notebook. So a new window with the plot will open when executing the last cell. If it does not appear, it might be hidden behind your web browser, reducing the size of it may allow you to see the plots."
